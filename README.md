# Air-Quality-Prediction-in-Delhi
The alarming rise in air pollution levels in Delhi presents a severe public health challenge. This project focuses on developing a sophisticated regression model to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) by analyzing major pollutant concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NH3, SO2, and CO. By leveraging machine learning techniques.
